# ── Manager image (web + API in one lean container) ─────────────────────────
# Deliberately contains NO game runtime (no Proton/SteamCMD) — game files run in
# separate containers (PLANNING.md → "Keep the manager image lean").
#
# Layered so the big, slow-changing dependency layer (~750 MB) is cached across
# code-only updates: an Unraid "update" then only pulls the ~85 MB of changed
# build artifacts, not the whole image.

# openssl + ca-certificates are required by Prisma's query/schema engines (the
# slim image omits them, which otherwise breaks `prisma migrate deploy` on boot).
# sqlite3 is used to take consistent online backups of Conan's live world database;
# unzip extracts uploaded Palworld .pak/framework archives into the instance dir.
