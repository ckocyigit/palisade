A self-hosted, Docker-based control panel for game dedicated servers — built
Unraid-first, but it runs on any Linux box with Docker. One lean manager
container spawns and supervises a container per game server, manages every
setting through schema-driven forms, and handles mods, backups, schedules,
player administration, and even your router's port-forwards.

## Quick start (Unraid)

1. **Apps tab → search "Palisade" → Install.** The defaults are ready to go — the
   only field to check is **App data**: point it at a folder on a real disk
   (`/mnt/cache/appdata/palisade`), *not* the `/mnt/user` FUSE share, so the game-file
   cache can reflink-clone between servers.
2. **Leave the secrets and `HOST_DATA_DIR` blank.** The manager generates and persists
   its own keys on first start and auto-detects the host data path — there's nothing to
   generate in a terminal.
3. **Open the WebUI**, create your admin account on the first-run screen, and add a game
   server. That's it.

> Not on Unraid? It's a single container — run the same image (`ghcr.io/shakes63/palisade`)
> with `/var/run/docker.sock` and a data volume mounted; see the template in
> [`unraid/palisade.xml`](unraid/palisade.xml) for the full env/mount list.

[^pal]: Palworld runs the **native Linux** server, so mods are `.pak` content mods plus
    Lua/Blueprint mods loaded by UE4SS. Official UE4SS releases are Windows-only — there is no
    `libUE4SS.so` there. Use the experimental
    [native Linux build](https://github.com/Yangff/RE-UE4SS/releases/tag/linux-experiment)
    (`UE4SS_0.0.0.zip`) and upload it in the server's Mods tab. DLL-based mods (PalGuard,
    PalDefender) cannot load into a Linux process; those require running the Windows server
    under Wine, which this image does not do.

[^palwine]: The **Palworld (Wine — full mods)** variant runs the **Windows** server under Wine,
    so DLL-based mods (PalGuard, PalDefender) load alongside Lua/Blueprint and `.pak` mods. The
    Mods tab installs the official
    [UE4SS Windows build](https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS/releases/tag/v3.0.1) into
    `Pal/Binaries/Win64`, where Wine auto-loads it via the `dwmapi.dll` proxy — no LD_PRELOAD.
    Heavier and crashier than the native variant; pick it only when you need DLL mods.

**Feature highlights**

- Create → install → start with per-game readiness detection, graceful
  shutdown, a crash watchdog, and a RAM guard that offers to back up + swap
  servers when memory is tight.
- Full per-game settings catalogs with presets, copy-between-servers, and
  restart-needed tracking.
- Live player counts for every game (A2S / RakNet ping / RCON / Valheim status
  endpoint) with 1-hour sparklines, plus a **Players** roster captured from
  player lists and join logs — kick / ban / whitelist / admin per game.
- Backups: manual + scheduled with retention, restore, browser download, and
  saves import. The manager also snapshots its own database nightly.
- Schedules (restart / update / backup / stop / start) with in-game countdown
  warnings, pre-action snapshots, and a "skip while players are online" guard.
- ARK cluster support (shared transfer dir across servers).
- Discord/webhook notifications, host low-disk warnings, editable ports with a
  start-time port-conflict guard.
- Optional **pfSense integration**: one-click WAN port-forward
  create/fix/enable/disable/delete per server via the pfSense REST API.

See [PLANNING.md](PLANNING.md) for architecture details.

## Architecture at a glance

```
palisade (this app) ────/var/run/docker.sock──> Docker daemon
   Next.js UI + NestJS API                       │ spawns
   SQLite · config engine · RCON · scheduler     ▼
                                       one container per game server
```

The manager is a **control plane only** — it contains no game runtime. Each
game server runs in its own container from a proven community image; the
manager injects config, watches logs, and talks RCON/telnet/query protocols.

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker on a Linux host (Unraid, Debian/Ubuntu, etc.). 16 GB+ RAM recommended —
  a single populated game server wants 2–16 GB depending on the game.
- A Docker bridge network for the manager (game containers join it too unless
  you use host networking):

  ```bash
  docker network create ark-net
  ```

- Two secrets (generate once, keep safe — `SECRETS_KEY` encrypts stored API
  keys/passwords, so losing it means re-entering them):

  ```bash
  echo "SECRETS_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
  echo "JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
  ```

- For the Wine/Proton games (Icarus, Enshrouded, V Rising, Sons of the Forest, LiF:YO), the **host** needs a larger
  mmap limit or the server crashes on boot:

  ```bash
  sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
  # persist it: /etc/sysctl.conf, or on Unraid append to /boot/config/go
  ```

### Option A — Unraid (Community Applications) ⭐ recommended

Palisade is in [Community Applications](https://ca.unraid.net): open the
**Apps** tab, search for **Palisade**, and install. The template pre-fills
everything except your two secrets (`SECRETS_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET` — generators
above) and the app-data path. The prerequisites above still apply: create the
`ark-net` network and set the `vm.max_map_count` sysctl once.

Two Unraid-specific notes baked into the template:
- Use a path on the cache disk itself (`/mnt/cache/appdata/...`), **not**
  `/mnt/user/...` — the ARK game-file cache reflink-clones between servers,
  which needs one real filesystem.
- Spawned game servers appear on the Docker page with per-game icons and WebUI
  buttons that deep-link back into Palisade.

(Manual alternative: drop [unraid/palisade.xml](unraid/palisade.xml) into
`/boot/config/plugins/dockerMan/templates-user/`.)

### Option B — plain `docker run`

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name palisade \
  --network ark-net \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 8970:3000 \
  -v /opt/palisade:/data \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
  -e NODE_ENV=production \
  -e DATA_DIR=/data \
  -e DATABASE_URL=file:/data/db.sqlite \
  -e HOST_DATA_DIR=/opt/palisade \
  -e PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://YOUR-LAN-IP:8970 \
  -e SECRETS_KEY=<64 hex chars> \
  -e JWT_SECRET=<random string> \
  -e PUID=99 -e PGID=100 \
  -e TZ=America/Chicago \
  -e GAME_HOST_NETWORK=true \
  ghcr.io/shakes63/palisade:latest
```

Then open `http://YOUR-LAN-IP:8970` and complete the first-run wizard
(create the admin account; API keys are optional and can be added later in
Settings).

### Option C — docker compose

A reference [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) ships in the repo:

```bash
export SECRETS_KEY=... JWT_SECRET=... HOST_DATA_DIR=/opt/palisade
docker compose up -d
```

### Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Default | What |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SECRETS_KEY` | **yes** | — | 64 hex chars (32 bytes). Encrypts stored secrets at rest. |
| `JWT_SECRET` | **yes** | — | Signs login tokens (sessions last 30 days). |
| `HOST_DATA_DIR` | **yes**¹ | `DATA_DIR` | The data dir **as the host's Docker daemon sees it** (e.g. `/mnt/user/appdata/ark-manager` on Unraid). Game-container bind mounts resolve on the host, not inside the manager. |
| `DATA_DIR` | no | `./data` | Data dir inside the manager container (mount your volume here, conventionally `/data`). |
| `DATABASE_URL` | no | `file:./data/db.sqlite` | SQLite path — keep it inside `DATA_DIR`. |
| `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | no | `http://localhost:3000` | The address you actually browse to. Used for links and Unraid WebUI buttons. |
| `GAME_HOST_NETWORK` | no | `false` | `true` = game containers use host networking (recommended — ASA/EOS and Steam query behave better without Docker NAT). Requires the `--add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway` flag on the manager so it can still reach RCON/query. |
| `DOCKER_HOST` | no | unix socket | Point at `tcp://socket-proxy:2375` for least-privilege Docker access ([docker-socket-proxy](https://github.com/Tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy)). |
| `PUID` / `PGID` | no | `99` / `100` | Ownership for game files written by the manager (Unraid's `nobody:users` by default). |
| `TZ` | no | `UTC` | Manager clock; also the default for game containers and schedules (overridable in Settings). |

¹ Required whenever the container path and host path differ — i.e. basically
always in production.

### Data layout

Everything lives under your data dir — one directory to back up:

```
/data
├── db.sqlite            # server definitions, schedules, players, settings
├── instances/<id>/      # each server's game files + world saves
├── backups/<id>/        # world snapshots (retention-rotated)
├── backups/_manager/    # nightly self-backups of db.sqlite (newest 14)
└── clusters/<id>/       # ARK cluster transfer dirs
```

Deleting a server from the UI asks whether to wipe its instance + backups, and
offers a browser download of the world saves first.

### Updating

Releases are versioned: every `vX.Y.Z` tag builds and publishes
`ghcr.io/shakes63/palisade:latest` plus matching `vX.Y.Z` / `vX.Y` tags (see
[Releases](https://github.com/Shakes63/palisade/releases) for changelogs). To
update: pull the new image and recreate the container (Unraid's update button
does both). Database migrations run automatically on boot. Prefer a fixed
version over `latest`? Point the template at a specific `vX.Y.Z` tag — any
published release remains pullable as a rollback pin.

**Channels:**

| Tag | Moves when | For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `latest` | a `vX.Y.Z` release is cut | most people |
| `vX.Y.Z` / `vX.Y` | that release | pinning / rollback |
| `nightly` | a nightly build is manually triggered | early testing, bleeding edge |
| `sha-<short>` | every build | immutable pin of an exact build |

`nightly` is a prerelease of unreleased `main` code (versioned like
`1.3.2-nightly.202607110245`) — expect rough edges, and note it may apply DB
migrations a later rollback to a stable release can't undo (Prisma migrates
forward only), so back up first. It never moves `latest`, so stable users
can't see it. Opting in and out is just which tag your container tracks:
point the image at `ghcr.io/shakes63/palisade:nightly` to ride prereleases,
and back at `:latest` to rejoin stable at the next release.

## Integrations (all optional, all in Settings)

| Integration | What it enables | What you need |
|---|---|---|
| CurseForge API key | ASA mod browser, Minecraft modpack browser | Free key from <https://console.curseforge.com/> |
| Steam Web API key | ASE/Conan Workshop browser | Free key from <https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey> |
| Discord webhook | State changes, crashes, backups, schedule events | A channel webhook URL |
| pfSense | Per-server WAN port-forward management (create / fix / enable / disable / delete, WAN IP display) | The free [pfSense REST API package](https://pfrest.org/) on your router + an API key (System → REST API). Works with any pfSense — nothing is network-specific. Use the **Test connection** button to validate. |

**CurseForge terms:** the mod browser uses the CurseForge API read-only to
search and display mods; it never downloads or redistributes mod files — the
game servers fetch mods themselves through official integrations. Bring your
own key; keys are non-transferable under CurseForge's
[3rd-party API terms](https://support.curseforge.com/en/support/solutions/articles/9000207405-curse-forge-3rd-party-api-terms-and-conditions).
This repo does not ship one.

## Reverse proxy / TLS

The app is LAN-first but proxy-friendly:

- Front it with Nginx Proxy Manager / Traefik / Caddy with TLS; proxy `/`,
  `/api`, and `/socket.io` to the web port (container port 3000) — the web app
  forwards API + websocket traffic internally.
- Set `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to the external origin.
- The manager controls Docker via the host socket. If you expose the UI beyond
  your LAN, strongly consider the socket-proxy setup above.

## Security

What's built in:

- **Auth**: single-admin JWT auth (bcrypt cost 12), 7-day tokens carrying a
  version claim checked against the DB on every request — `POST
  /auth/logout-all` instantly invalidates every outstanding token. Login and
  first-run are rate-limited (5/min per client). The realtime socket requires
  the same token; anonymous connections never receive log or console traffic.
- **API**: helmet security headers; CORS denies cross-origin by default
  (browsers reach the API same-origin through the web app). Serving the UI
  from a different origin needs `CORS_ORIGINS` (comma-separated allowlist).
- **Docker access**: least-privilege via
  [docker-socket-proxy](https://github.com/Tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy) —
  see `docker-compose.yml`. The manager then only reaches container/image
  endpoints; exec, volumes, networks, build, and secrets are denied at the
  proxy. Note the proxy filters endpoints, not payloads: container creation
  stays possible, so this narrows the blast radius rather than eliminating it.
- **Game containers** run with `no-new-privileges`, a pids limit, and RAM
  caps; console/RCON arguments are sanitized against command injection from
  player-chosen names.
- **Supply chain**: CI blocks the image build on high/critical production
  dependency vulnerabilities (pnpm audit) and Trivy-scans the built image for
  CRITICAL CVEs before pushing; the base image is digest-pinned.
- **Backups** are verified: the manager's nightly DB snapshot must pass
  SQLite's `integrity_check`, and world backups record their size and raise a
  warning event when a snapshot captures no files.

Trade-off to know about: **game-server images are pulled by floating tags**
(usually `:latest`, as their maintainers publish them). That's what keeps
game updates one click away, but it means those images change underneath you
outside Palisade's control. The game containers' runtime caps above (plus
per-container RAM limits) bound what a misbehaving image can do — but treat
game images with the same trust you'd give installing that community image
by hand.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install

# generate secrets, then copy .env.example → .env
node -e "console.log('SECRETS_KEY=' + require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
node -e "console.log('JWT_SECRET='  + require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"

pnpm --filter @ark/api db:push   # create the dev SQLite db
pnpm dev                         # API on :8787 + web on :3000
pnpm --filter @ark/api test      # unit tests
```

Monorepo layout: `packages/shared` (types + settings catalogs contract),
`apps/api` (NestJS orchestrator), `apps/web` (Next.js UI), `docker/` (manager
entrypoint), `unraid/` (CA template).
